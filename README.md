# Car Damage Detection Model using Deep Learning
A deep learning project to classify car images as "damaged" or "whole" using MobileNetV2 and TensorFlow. Includes training, testing, and prediction scripts.
## Objective
Develop an AI Model using MobileNetV2, Tensorflow, and Keras to train it with car images classifying as 'damaged' and 'whole'. The goal is to make it accurately differentiate between a damaged and undamaged car.
## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available in Kaggle and must be extracted in the following structure:
car_data/data1a/ â”œâ”€â”€ training/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 00-damage/ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ 01-whole/ 
                 â””â”€â”€ validation/ â”œâ”€â”€ 00-damage/ â””â”€â”€ 01-whole/
## Model
- Uses **MobileNetV2** as the feature extractor
- Custom head: GlobalAveragePooling2D + Dense + Dropout + Softmax
- Trained using **Adam optimizer** and **categorical crossentropy**
- Epochs: 5 (can be increased for better performance)
- Accuracy improves with more data and fine-tuning
